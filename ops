But warn returns true, which is the last value set before the _resolv sub returns causing the termination above.\n\nYou need to add \"return undef;\" before the closing brace of _resolv\n\nBy the way Net::Ping installs to /perl/lib, but distributions such as ActiveState install to /perl/site/lib so when I installed your update it was not seen as @INC has /perl/site/lib first","files":null}]}
