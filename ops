It only croaks on more severe problems, like wrong family, invalid params and such.\n\nThe warning is fair, since ping expects a IP and checks a route to the host. If the error is elsewhere, like in the resolver, this error is unexpected and thus warns. We cannot just silently ignore a resolver failure. We should only silently return undef when the route is off, but not when the DNS is off.\n\nCan you check again where it croaks?","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"8bb2e2064051e551a5dd57a858a993fc9e61081d"},"timestamp":1613990139,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDE0OlVubGFiZWxlZEV2ZW50NDM1ODkyNzAwNA=="},"added":[],"removed":["bug"]},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"8bb2e2064051e551a5dd57a858a993fc9e61081d"},"timestamp":1613990139,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOkxhYmVsZWRFdmVudDQzNTg5MjcwMDU="},"added":["invalid"],"removed":[]},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"8bb2e2064051e551a5dd57a858a993fc9e61081d"},"timestamp":1613991597,"metadata":{"github-id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc4MzI4OTU3NA==","github-url":"https://github.com/rurban/Net-Ping/issues/26#issuecomment-783289574"},"message":"Have no idea what's going with your _namedargs.tmodule.
